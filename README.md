# open-coras
A bootc based linux distribution by Mehal Technologies.

This distribution is intended for developers interested in investigating gitops in a bootc environment.

Out of the box it supports gitops scenarios where the deployment configuration is also open. 

If more private repositories and/or complex deployments such as canary releases are required it's suggested you integrate this distribution with [CLOS](https://clos.mehal.tech).

# notes

The user name and password for this image is `bootcer` with `thepassword`. It's obviously recommended that the `bootcer` user is deleted as part of the downstream build. 

For a more robust security posture consider using the supported coras distribution.
